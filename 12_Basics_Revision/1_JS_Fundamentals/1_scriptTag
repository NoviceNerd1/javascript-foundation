Here’s a succinct, technical summary of that content, trimmed of fluff and aligned with engineering discipline:

⸻

🔹 Core Concepts Recap: “Hello, World!” in JavaScript

✅ Purpose:
	•	This section focuses purely on core JavaScript (the language), not on browser-specific APIs.
	•	Browser is used as the execution environment for convenience, but principles apply equally to Node.js and other runtimes.

⸻

🔹 Script Execution in HTML

🔸 Basic Inline Script:

<script>
  alert('Hello, world!');
</script>

	•	Code inside <script> runs when the browser parses that tag.
	•	Positioning matters: scripts can affect rendering depending on where they are in the DOM.

🔸 Legacy Attributes (now obsolete):
	•	type="text/javascript" → No longer required; JS is default.
	•	language="javascript" → Obsolete since the early 2000s.
	•	<!-- ... //--> → Ancient browser hack to hide JS from non-JS browsers. If you see this in code, it belongs in a museum.

⸻

🔹 External Scripts

✅ Usage:

<script src="/path/to/script.js"></script>

	•	Absolute or relative paths allowed.
	•	Can load from CDNs (e.g., lodash via cdnjs).
	•	Prefer external scripts for:
	•	Reuse
	•	Caching
	•	Cleaner HTML
	•	Separation of concerns

⚠️ Rule:

Don’t mix src and inline code inside the same <script> tag. If src is present, the inner code is ignored.

✅ Correct:

<script src="file.js"></script>
<script>
  alert(1);
</script>


⸻

🔹 Performance Note:
	•	External scripts can be cached by browsers, reducing redundant network usage and speeding up load time across pages.

⸻

🔹 TL;DR for Engineers

Feature	Recommendation
<script> position	Place where needed in flow
type, language	Obsolete—don’t use
Mixing inline + src	Invalid — use separate tags
Use of <script>	Inline for trivial, external for real code
Browser-specific JS	Avoid for now — not focus of core JS
