# JavaScript Foundations – Prep for TypeScript & Frameworks

This repository documents my focused brush-up on core JavaScript concepts as a precursor to mastering TypeScript and modern JavaScript frameworks (e.g., Next.js, React, Node.js, etc.).

## 🎯 Objective

Rebuild JavaScript fundamentals from the ground up to eliminate surface-level understanding, sloppy syntax, and mental gaps—so I can write clean, confident code in any JS stack.

## 🔍 Focus Areas

- ✅ Primitives, Objects, Arrays
- ✅ Functions, Closures, Callbacks
- ✅ Scope, Hoisting, `this`, Execution Context
- ✅ Promises, Async/Await, Event Loop
- ✅ DOM Basics (Optional)
- ✅ `Date`, `Math`, `Intl`, Timers
- ✅ ES6+ Syntax (`let`, `const`, arrow functions, destructuring, spread/rest)
- ✅ Debugging, Console Tools, Developer Patterns

## 🚀 Next Step

Once this foundation is solid, I’ll transition into:

- TypeScript (type safety, interfaces, generics)
- Next.js (App Router, SSR, API routes)
- NestJS (for backend structure)
- Real-world full stack projects

## 🛠️ How I'm Practicing

- Writing raw JS code from scratch
- Testing in Node.js and browser
- Simulating real-world mini tasks (e.g., time loggers, formatters, API mocks)
- Avoiding tutorials where I just “follow along”

## 🧠 Why This Matters

> A sloppy JS foundation leads to confusion in frameworks and tech debt in projects. I'm eliminating that risk here—with intention, clarity, and reps.
